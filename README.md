## What is Sketch?

Sketch is a macOS-native vector design application tailored for UI/UX designers, product teams, and illustrators who need a focused, efficient tool for screen design. It provides a lightweight but powerful vector editor with features that accelerate interface creation: artboards for multiple screens, reusable symbols for components, constraints for responsive layouts, and shared libraries to maintain design systems across projects.

Beyond basic drawing, Sketch offers powerful export options and developer handoff tools so assets move from design to production cleanly. Collaboration features allow teams to share libraries and sync components, while plugins and integrations expand the toolset with prototyping, icon generation, and asset management workflows. Sketch's workflow is optimized for iteration: build symbols, update instances, and push changes across designs instantly.

Performance and ergonomics are core strengths. Sketch balances precision vector tools with convenient layout helpers, snapping guides, and pixel alignment for screen-accurate output. It runs smoothly on Apple Silicon and Intel Macs, and supports modern file formats for easy integration with design pipelines. Whether creating icons, app screens, or full design systems, Sketch streamlines repetitive tasks and keeps design data organized for teams and individual creators alike.
